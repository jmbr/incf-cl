(defun fixed-point (function initial-value &key (test #'eql) max-steps)
  "Returns the fixed point of FUNCTION starting with INITIAL-VALUE.
The keyword argument TEST determines when a fixed point has been
reached.  Use MAX-STEPS to stop after a certain (positive) number of
iterations.

For example, the square root of 2 using Newton's method can be
computed as:

INCF-CL> (fixed-point (lambda (x)
                        (float (- x (/ (- (expt x 2) 2) (* 2 x)))))
                      1)
1.4142135

INCF-CL> (sqrt 2)
1.4142135"
  (nest function
        initial-value :n 1
        :test-not test :m 2
        :max (if max-steps
                 (+ 2 max-steps)
                 nil)))
